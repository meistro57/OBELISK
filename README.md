# OBELISK
A modular multi-agent system that fuses Claude, Codex, and ChatGPT into a collaborative intelligence engine. OBELISK is the sacred architecture of thought—planning, building, and refining code from idea to execution.

# 🗿 OBELISK

**OBELISK** is an elite-level multi-agent orchestration framework that unifies the strengths of multiple LLMs—Claude, Codex (GPT-4o), and ChatGPT—into a single collaborative intelligence system.

It’s not just an AI assistant.

It’s a digital monument to autonomous thought, evolving code, and machine-assisted creativity.

- **Architect Agent** – Claude: system design & planning
- **Engineer Agent** – Codex: code generation & integration
- **Synthesizer Agent** – ChatGPT: testing, QA, documentation, polish
